"""Output sweep: look for surprises in the model's answer after tokens were restored.

Two things are worth flagging. The model may invent a token that was never allocated, which means it
hallucinated a reference. It may also emit brand new personal data that nobody sent it. Neither
blocks the answer; both are logged and shown as a hint.

    Names on the `allowlist` are not reported: an answer about a campaign on Facebook is expected
    to say "Facebook".

    A detection counts as new only when some letter or digit of it lies outside every known value
    and every token in the answer. Comparing whole strings reported the conversation's own data as
    new whenever a guard read it with a trailing full stop, read part of it, or read two known
    values as one name.

    A known value with letters glued to it counts as known too. Polish inflects a name in a
    sentence, so a restored answer says "Jan Kowalskiego" where the mapping holds "Jan Kowalski";
    the letters the token took on are not personal data the model invented.

    space in it is still a PESEL, and a known name spelled in capitals or with a no-break space is
